# Greenkeeper Monorepo Definitions
This module groups npm packages into monorepo releases so Greenkeeper can update them together. It is required by both [Greenkeeper](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper) and [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) and used as the source of truth on which modules constitute part of a monorepo release and should therefore be updated together.

The instances of `greenkeeper-lockfile` running on your CI will always automatically install the most recent release of this module on each CI run, so you donâ€™t have to update `greenkeeper-lockfile` every time someone updates a monorepo dependency.

## Submitting Additions and Changes
The maintainers of Greenkeeper aim to keep this list current and useful, but weâ€™re also extremely grateful if you, the users and maintainers of monorepo dependencies, could help us keep this list in good shape ðŸ’š

Please submit additions and changes via a PR and adhere to the following format (or check the existing definitions in `index.js`):
